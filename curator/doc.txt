Endpoint: /getImage (no params)
    Returns a random image that has no metadata.

    {
        source: "babepedia",
        slug: "Model_model",
        hash: "e652ba523bef87f8",
        filename: "model_model_33.jpg",
        url: "www.source.com/path/model_model_33.jpg",

        modelUrl: "babepedia.com/babe/Model_model",
        content: "fsdkn85Gdfg5345GDFGDFggSA+SD3412FSDF/="
    }

    This should be enough to display the image (sent in base64 or hex) and show links to the original image and model page.

    The frontend shows the image together with a way to crop the image and select metadata with radios or dropdowns.



Endpoint: /saveImage (source + slug + hash, metadata)
    Saves the crop and metadata of an image



HTTP: index.html
    static, simply invokes the endpoints and constructs the DOM as required
